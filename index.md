# Week 7 - Child Themes

A series of exercises to create a [child WordPress theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) of [Satu](http://wordpress.org/themes/satu).

### Tips

#### Stay organised
Try to keep your CSS organised and tidy. Use the `style.css` file in the Satu theme as an example. It's very well organised with a [comment] at the top of the file with a table of contents and a comment at the beginning of each section.

## Exercise two

Change the highlight colour used on the site from red to a more appropriate colour of your choice. 

### Method

Like exercise one, this will involve overriding the parent theme's CSS with new CSS in your child theme's `style.css` file, however this time, there will be a few different style declarations required.

First, find the hexadecimal
